## Overview
This repository contains data and analysis scripts for a book chapter investigating regional and authorship representation in psychotherapy RCTs (1990–2022). The corresponding book chapter has been published in [A Better How: Notes on Developmental Meta-Research](https://www.busara.global/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/A-Better-How-Book.pdf).

## How to use the data
The scripts are prepared so that the data will be directly loaded from the GitHub repository link without downloading the data manually.

## Abstract
We systematically analyzed 17,095 psychotherapy RCTs published between 1990 and 2022 to examine regional patterns in first and co-authorship affiliations. North America’s dominance in first authorships declined over time, while Asia’s share notably increased. However, Latin America, Africa, and Oceania remained underrepresented. Global North authors continued to dominate research teams, though Global South-only and mixed teams grew steadily, indicating a slow shift toward more diverse and international collaboration in psychotherapy research.
